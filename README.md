# The C/O monitor code for comprehensive data analysis

The code was created to perform various calculations of potential C/O monitor signals and validate experimental data of the Lyman-alpha lines measurements of hydrogen like ions of B, C, N and O. The code calculates only the line intensities of the given transitions but does not calculate the background radiation (at least not for now).

## The code consists of three main sections:
### Module 1 - Reff calculation
Using VMEC code. Field line tracer will be included for edge plasma modeling.
Development of the description TBD

### Module 2 - Geometry calculation
Development of the description TBD 

### Module 3 - Emissivity calculation
Development of the description TBD
